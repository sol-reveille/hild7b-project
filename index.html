            <p>
                The Burlingame Treaty (or Burlingame-Seward Treaty of 1868) was a treaty signed with Qing China. It lifted all former immigration restrictions from China to the United States,
                and vice versa. The US also recognized China’s right of eminent domain and let China appoint consuls at US ports. More importantly, it reaffirmed the rights of Chinese 
                citizens in the United States and US citizens in China, as well as granted certain privileges like access to public education. Naturalization was notably left off of those privileges.

                <h2>Historical Context: Transcontinental Railroad</h2>
                <p>
                    The treaty was the result of the desperate lack of workers needed to build the Transcontinental Railroad. However, not enough white laborers were willing to sign up on the 
                    West Coast. The idea of hiring Chinese laborers apparently came from the Chinese manservant of the director of the Central Pacific Railroad Company (CPRR).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chinese laborers first started working on the Transcontinental Railroad in January 1864. The president of the CPRR wrote that it would be impossible to complete the western 
                    half of the railroad in time without the Chinese. By 1867, ninety percent, or around eleven thousand, of the laborers in California working on the railroad were Chinese. In the 
                    beginning, they came from local communities, but many were soon recruited from overseas.

            <h2>Historical Context: 19th Century China</h2>
            <p>
                Most workers recruited to work on the railroad came from Guangdong province. China at the time was still recovering from the Taiping Rebellion and Second Opium War, as well as 
                general civil unrest. They had been defeated by British and French forces over incidents involving foreigners in China, and then forced to cede land to Russia. Economic opportunities 
                were low, which was why many in the south chose to come to California, first for the Gold Rush and then to build the railroad.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Xianfeng Emperor had also been worried that China was losing labor to the United States. Emigration was restricted by the Chinese government, though those laws were usually ignored. 
                The Burlingame Treaty therefore allowed the United States access to the labor they needed for the Transcontinental Railroad.

                <h2>Historical Context: the Gold Rush</h2>
                <p>
                    Though the Transcontinental Railroad would come to rely so much on Chinese labor, the CPRR was initially resistant to the idea. This was due to the high anti-Asian sentiment in 
                    California near the end of the Gold Rush. Chinese communities had formed in and around San Francisco and remained even after the Gold Rush was over. These were the railroad’s source 
                    of workers for their trial run of Chinese labor, before they started recruiting in earnest.

            <h2>Significance</h2>
            <p>
                The Burlingame Treaty was the last major piece of legislation that opened the United States to Chinese immigration before the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 placed heavy restrictions on it. 
                Consequently, there was a large influx of Chinese immigrants to California, constituting the first wave of Chinese immigration to the United States. This sudden increase of immigrants and 
                the use of their cheap labor also exacerbated racial tensions. Because Chinese laborers worked for less, many non-Chinese workers came to see them as a threat to their jobs. The rising 
                anti-Asian sentiment, and lack of further economic incentive to encourage immigration, led to the overwhelming support for the Chinese Exclusion Act.
